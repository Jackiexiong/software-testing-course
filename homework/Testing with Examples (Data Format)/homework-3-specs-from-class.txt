The specs from class.

1) Date needs to be MM-DD-YYYY.  
1.1) MM, DD, and YYYY should be numbers.
2) 1900-2100 (both inclusive) is the valid range for year in date.
3) Name has to be at least 2 characters
4) Gender values are "M" and "F"
5) Valid character class for Names is alphanum, ' ', and '-'
6) 95-104 (both inclusive) is the valid range for temperature.
6.1) temperature should be a float.  
6.2) unit is Fahrenheit.  (Does this matter?)
7) Date is a valid calendar date.
8) 17-84 (both inclusive) is the valid range for height.
8.1) height should be an integer (given in the problem)
8.2) unit is Inches.  
9) Name contains at least 1 alphabet character.
10) Name can be a single word.
11) Name cannot be just spaces.
12) No restriction max length of Name.
13) 2 digit precision for temperature.


Things to think about
- How does 6.1 or 8.2 help the tester or the developer?)
- Can you test for (13)?
- About name,
  - (3) and (12) constraint the length of Name
  - (5) constraints the class of characters that can occur in Name
  - (10) constraints the structure of Name (in terms of words)
  - (9) and (11) constraints the composition of Name (in terms of how many characters of specific class).
    - Given (9), 11 is redundant.
  - These constraints allow for names such as "A " or "9-".  We can address this with one more constraint -- (14) Name contains at least 2 alphanumeric character.  This was the only missed constraint.
