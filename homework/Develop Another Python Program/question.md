Joan is almost done implementing a cool tic-tac-toe game.  However, she is running short on time to complete the implementation.  She needs help implementing a function *tic_tac_toe_check* that checks if the given board configuration (a list of strings) has one winning (three-in-a-row/column/diagonal) pattern and returns the symbol used to form the winning pattern.

Your task is to help Joan by implementing this function. [15 points]

Submit your implementation in a single file named _impl.py_.

We will place your submission in a folder with our evaluation tests.  Our tests will import your module via `import impl` and access the implementation using the above signature.  Naming your files and implementation appropriately to enable this composability is worth 1 point.

Please resolve any ambiguities about the problem by discussing them with the TA or the instructor ONLY via email or in-person.  When you identify ambiguities, describe them precisely and pose questions about them that will help you resolve ambiguities.  Examples of bad questions would be "what is missing in my implementation?" and "do you think my implementation is complete?"  Examples of good questions would be "Am I right in assuming sun goes around the moon?" and "when you said celestial bodies, did you mean the sun or the moon or something else?"

As mentioned in the policies of the course, collaboration is not allowed on assignments.  So, do not use the discussion board to pose and discuss your questions.
