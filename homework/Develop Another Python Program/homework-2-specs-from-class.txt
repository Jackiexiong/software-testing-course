Given the signature tic_tac_toe_check(config), the specs are

1) config is of list type
2) config has 9 elements
3) All elements of config are of length 1
4) tic_tac_toe_check returns the symbol forming the winning pattern 
5) if no winner, return None
6) 'x', 'o', and '' as the only allowed elements in config
7) if there is more than 1 winner, then flag error by raising ValueError exception
8) config represents the board left to right and top to bottom

(4) was given as part of the problem.

Given (6), (3) is redundant.

When 1 and 2 are violated, the function should raise TypeError exception.
