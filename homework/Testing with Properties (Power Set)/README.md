George has written a Python function `make_power_set(s)` that calculates the power set of the set of unique values provided in s.  Your task is to help George test `make_power_set` function.

Submit your tests in a single file named *test_impl.py*.

You should assume the UUT is available in *impl.py *file.  So, in your test file, you should use appropriate import statement and name qualification to access the implementation.  Composability of your tests with our implementation is worth 1 point.

To evaluate your tests, we will use PyTest.  We will execute the command pytest-2.9.x in a folder with your *test_impl.py* file and our *impl.py* files, i.e., one execution of pytest-2.9.x for each variant of our implementation.

Please resolve any ambiguities about the problem by discussing them with the users (TA or instructor) via email or in-person.  When you identify ambiguities, try to describe them precisely and pose questions about them that will help remove ambiguities.

**Note: This is an unused question; hence, it may be incomplete.**
