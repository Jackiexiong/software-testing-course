Each module/topic has a dedicated folder.  Each folder contains corresponding slide decks in PDF format.  *code-snippets-x* folders contain the code snippets used in live coding sessions when discussing the corresponding topic.  If there is only one code snippet, then it is placed in the topic folder.  At times,  any notes used during the live code sessions is placed in *notes.txt* file.
