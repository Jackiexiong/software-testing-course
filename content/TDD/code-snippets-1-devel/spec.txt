- x, y, and z have to be integers (we'll assume length of sides are integers)

- if all three sides are equal, then return "equilateral"
- if two sides are equal, then return "isoceles"
- if no sides are equal, then return "scalene"

- sides should be greater than 0 in length; if not, raise RuntimeError
- sides put together form a triangle
  - sum of two sides should be greater than the third side
  - return "Not a triangle"
