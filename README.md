# Software Testing Techniques (CIS640) Course

This is the content of **Software Testing Techniques (CIS640)** course offered at Kansas State University in Spring'16 and Spring'17.  The course is intended for upper-level undergraduates (seniors) and beginning graduates.  It requires students to have taken courses on programming, logic, software design, and discrete mathematics.

## Aspects of the Course

- Class room instruction revolved around open questions posed to students.  [Socratic Method]
- Students answers were collected on the whiteboard and discussed to arrive at "expert" answers.
- Students directed instructor in live coding sessions to arrive at "expert" solutions.
- Sketch slides were used in class to drive discussion.  These slides were extended with highlights from classroom discussion (marked by _*_) and posted after class.
- Homework questions were seeded with ambiguity to simulate specification elicitation to resolve ambiguity and, consequently, identify testing boundaries.
- Textbooks were not required as there were none that described most of topics covered in the course.
- Few fringe/newer topics such as mutation testing and BDD were discussed.


## Content 

- Content slide decks interspersed with answers collected in class and answers for homework.
- Quiz question bank.
- Homework assignments along with solutions and scripts to evaluate submissions.
- Extra credit assignments along with solutions and scripts to evaluate submissions.
- Mid-term and end-term exams with solutions.
