# Software Testing Techniques Course

This is the content of software testing techniques course offered at Kansas State University in Spring'16 and Spring'17.  It was intended for upper undergraduates (seniors) and beginning graduates.  It required students to have taken courses on programming, logic, software design, and discrete mathematics.

Here are some aspects of the course.

- Class room instruction revolved around open questions posed to students.  [Socratic Method]
- Students answers were collected on the whiteboard and discussed to arrive at "expert" answers.
- Students directed instructor in live coding sessions to arrive at "expert" solutions.
- Sketch slides were used in class to drive discussion.  These slides were extended with highlights from classroom discussion (marked by _*_) and posted after class.
- Homework questions were seeded with ambiguity to simulate specification elicitation to resolve ambiguity and, consequently, identify testing boundaries.
- Textbooks were not required as there were none that described most of topics covered in the course.
- Few fringe/newer topics such as mutation testing and BDD were discussed.

The content contains
- content slide decks interspersed with answers collected in class and answers for homework,
- quiz question bank,
- homework assignments along with solutions and scripts to evaluate submissions,
- extra credit assignments along with solutions and scripts to evaluate submissions, and
- mid-term and end-term exams with solutions.
