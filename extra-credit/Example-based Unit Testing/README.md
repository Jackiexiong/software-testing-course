This assignment is intended to explore example-based unit testing in Python.

This is the dual of 'Develop Another Python Program' homework

Joan is almost done implementing a cool tic-tac-toe game.  However, she is running short on time to complete the implementation.  She needs help implementing a function `tic_tac_toe_check` that checks if the given board configuration (a list of strings) has one winning (three-in-a-row/column/diagonal) pattern and returns the symbol used to form the winning pattern.

A slew of developers created different implementations of `tic_tac_toe_check`.  Now, to select one of these implementations to use, Joan needs your help to identify which of these implementations are correct.  For this purpose, she wants you to write unit tests to test implementations of this function. [15 points]

Submit your implementation in a single file named test_impl.py.

We will place your submission in a folder with an implementation *impl.py* and execute `pytest test_impl.py`.  Naming your file appropriately to enable this composability is worth 1 point.  We will evaluate your tests on their ability to correctly identify/flag valid and invalid implementations of the signature/interface. 

Please resolve any ambiguities about the problem by discussing them with the TA or the instructor ONLY via email or in-person.  When you identify ambiguities, describe them precisely and pose questions about them that will help you resolve ambiguities.  Examples of bad questions would be "what is missing in my implementation?" and "do you think my implementation is complete?"  Examples of good questions would be "Am I right in assuming sun goes around the moon?" and "when you said celestial bodies, did you mean the sun or the moon or something else?"

As mentioned in the policies of the course, collaboration is not allowed on assignments.  So, do not use the discussion board to pose and discuss your questions.
